# R Interface to Google CloudML

![](images/cloudml.png){align=right width=200px style="margin-left: 10px;"}

The **cloudml** package provides an R interface to [Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/), a managed service that enables:

* Scalable training of models built with the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/), [tfestimators](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators), and [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) R packages.

* On-demand access to training on GPUs, including the new [Tesla P100 GPUs](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) from NVIDIA&reg;. 

* Hyperparameter tuning to optmize key attributes of model architectures in order to maximize predictive accuracy.

* Deployment of trained models to the Google global prediction platform that can support thousands of users and TBs of data.

## Getting Started

### Google Cloud Account

Before you can begin training models with CloudML you need to have a *Google Cloud Account*. If you don't already have an account you can create one at <https://console.cloud.google.com>. 

If you are a new customer of Google Cloud you will receive a [12-month, $300 credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions#free-trial) that can be applied to your use of CloudML.

### Installation

Start by installing the cloudml R package from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/cloudml")
```

Then, install the *Google Cloud SDK*, a set of utilties that enable you to interact with your Google Cloud account from within R. You can install the SDK using the `gcloud_install()` function. 

```{r}
library(cloudml)
gcloud_install()
```

Note that in order to ensure that the **cloudml** package can find your installation of the SDK you should accept the default installation location (`~/`) suggested within the installer.

Once you've completed these steps you are ready to train models with CloudML!

### Training on CloudML

To train a model on CloudML, first work the training script locally (perhaps with a smaller sample of your dataset). The script can contain arbitrary R code which trains and/or evaluates a model. Once you've confirmed that things work as expected, you can submit a CloudML job to perform training in the cloud.

#### Submitting a Job

To submit a job, call the `cloudml_train()` function, specifying the R script to execute for training:

```{r}
library(cloudml)
cloudml_train("train.R")
```

All of the files within the current working directory will be bundled up and sent along with the script to CloudML.

If you are using [RStudio v1.1](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or higher, then the CloudML training job is monitored (and it's results collected) using a background terminal:

#### Collecting Results

When the job is complete, training results can be collected back to your local system (this is done automatically when monitoring the job using a background terminal in RStudio). A run report is displayed after the job is collected:

![](images/training-run.png){.screenshot width=730px}

You can list all previous runs as a data frame using the `ls_runs()` function:

```{r}
ls_runs()
```
```

You can view run reports using the `view_run()` function:

```{r}
# view the latest run
view_run()

# view a specific run
view_run("runs/cloudml_2017_12_15_182614794")
```

There are many tools available to list, filter, and compare training runs. For additional information see the documentation for the [tfruns package](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/articles/overview.html).

### Training with a GPU

By default, CloudML utilizes "standard" CPU-based instances suitable for training simple models with small to moderate datasets. You can request the use of other machine types, including ones with GPUs, using the `master_type` parameter of `cloudml_train()`. 

For example, the following would train the same model as above but with a [Tesla K80 GPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-k80.html):

```{r}
cloudml_train("train.R", master_type = "standard_gpu")
```

To train using a [Tesla P100 GPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) you would specify `"standard_p100"`:

```{r}
cloudml_train("train.R", master_type = "standard_p100")
```

To train on a machine with 4 Tesla P100 GPU's you would specify `"complex_model_m_p100"`:

```{r}
cloudml_train("train.R", master_type = "complex_model_m_p100")
```

See the CloudML website for documentation on [available machine types](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/training-overview#machine_type_table). Also note that GPU instances can be considerably more expensive that CPU ones! See the documentation on [CloudML Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/pricing) for details.
