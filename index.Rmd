[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/cloudml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/cloudml) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cloudml)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cloudml)

## R Interface to Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine

The **cloudml** package provides an R interface to [Google Cloud Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/). CloudML makes it easy to run training applications built with R packages like [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/), [tfestimators](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators), and [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) in the cloud.

CloudML is a very cost-effective way to use GPUs for training models, since you only pay for the GPU compute time that your training jobs actually consume (as opposed to investing in a dedicated GPU machine either locally or in the cloud). 

CloudML also provides facilites for tuning the hyperparameters of models. Hyperparameter tuning takes advantage of the processing infrastructure of Google Cloud Platform to test different hyperparameter configurations when training your model. It can give you optimized values for hyperparameters, which maximizes your model's predictive accuracy.

## Installation

Before you can begin training models with CloudML you need to have a *Google Cloud Account*. If you don't already have an account you can create one at <https://console.cloud.google.com>.

Start by installing the cloudml R package from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/cloudml")
```

Then, install the *Google Cloud SDK*, a set of utilties that enable you to interact with your Google Cloud account from within R. You can install the SDK using the `gcloud_install()` function. 

```{r}
library(cloudml)
gcloud_install()
```

Note that in order to ensure that the **cloudml** package can find your installation of the SDK you should accept the default installation location (`~/`) suggested within the installer.

Once you've completed these steps you are ready to train models with CloudML!

## Training on CloudML

To train a model on CloudML, first work the training script locally (perhaps with a smaller sample of your dataset). The script can contain arbitrary R code which trains and/or evaluates a model. Once you've confirmed that things work as expected, you can submit a CloudML job to perform training in the cloud.

### Submitting a Job

To submit a job, call the `cloudml_train()` function, specifying the R script to execute for training:

```{r}
library(cloudml)
cloudml_train("train.R")
```

All of the files within the current working directory will be bundled up and sent along with the script to CloudML.

If you are using [RStudio v1.1](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or higher, then the CloudML training job is monitored (and it's results collected) using a background terminal:

![](images/rstudio-terminal.png){.screenshot width=730px}

### Collecting Results

When the job is complete, training results can be collected back to your local system (this is done automatically when monitoring the job using a background terminal in RStudio). A run report is displayed after the job is collected:

![](images/training-run.png){.screenshot width=730px}

Artifacts of your training run (e.g. saved models) are downloaded along with various run metrics and saved to the `runs` sub-directory of the working directory from which you submitted your training job.

### Training with a GPU

By default, CloudML utilizes CPU based instances for training. You can request the use of a GPU using the `scale_tier` parameter of `cloudml_train()`. For example, the following would train the same model as above but with a GPU:

```{r}
cloudml_train("train.R", scale_tier = "basic-gpu")
```

Note that GPU instances are more expensive that CPU ones! See the documentation on [CloudML Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/pricing) for additional information.

## CloudML Workflow

The basic steps described above are the essential components of working with CloudML. That said, there are many flexible options available for managing jobs, viewing results, and specifying the compute resources required for training. This section describes this functionality in more detail.

### Local Development

Working on a CloudML project always begins with developing a training script that runs on your local machine. This will typically involve using some combination of the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/), [tfestimators](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators), and [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) packages. Once your script is working the way you expect you are ready to submit it to CloudML.



### Training Jobs

The core unit of work in CloudML is a job. A job consists of a training script and related files (e.g. other scripts, data files, ec.). To submit a job to CloudML you use the `cloudml_train()` function, passing it the name of the training script to run. For example:

```{r}
job <- cloudml_train("minst_mlp.R")
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
Note that the CloudML training and job management functions described here all work relative to the current working directory of your R session, so you should always switch to the working directory containing your scripts before executing these functions.
</div>

The `cloudml_train()` function returns a `job` object. This is a reference to the training job which you can use later to check it's status, collect it's output, etc. For example:

```{r}
job_status(job)
```
```
 $ createTime    : chr "2017-12-18T20:35:21Z"
 $ etag          : chr "2KRqIbAhzvM="
 $ jobId         : chr "cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175"
 $ startTime     : chr "2017-12-18T20:35:52Z"
 $ state         : chr "RUNNING"
 $ trainingInput :List of 3
  ..$ jobDir        : chr "gs://cedar-card-791/r-cloudml/staging"
  ..$ region        : chr "us-east1"
  ..$ runtimeVersion: chr "1.4"
 $ trainingOutput:List of 1
  ..$ consumedMLUnits: num 0.04

View job in the Cloud Console at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/ml/jobs/cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175?project=cedar-card-791

View logs at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?resource=ml.googleapis.com%2Fjob_id%2Fcloudml_2017_12_18_203510175&project=cedar-card-791
```

You can call `job_collect()` at any time to download the job:

```{r}
job_collect(job)
```

If it hasn't already completed, R will block waiting for the job to complete and then perform the download. After the job has downloaded a report showing the results of the job will be automatically displayed.

To interact with jobs you don't need the `job` object returned from `cloudml_train()`. If you call `job_status()` or `job_collect()` with no arguments they will act on the most recently submitted job:

```{r}
job_status()   # get status of last job
job_collect()  # collect last job
```

You can also list jobs and then reference them by job ID:

```{r}
job_list()
```
```
                        JOB_ID    STATUS             CREATED
1 cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 15:35:21
2 cloudml_2017_12_18_202228264    FAILED 2017-12-18 15:22:39
3 cloudml_2017_12_18_201607948 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 15:16:18
4 cloudml_2017_12_18_132620918 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 08:26:30
5 cloudml_2017_12_15_182614794 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-15 13:26:29
6 cloudml_2017_12_14_183247626 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-14 13:33:04
```

```{r}
job_collect("cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175")
```

### Training Runs

Each training job will produce one or more training runs (it's typically only a single run, however when doing hyperparmeter turning there will be multiple runs). When you collect a job from CloudML it is automatically downloaded into the `runs` sub-directory of the current working directory.

You can list all of the runs as a data frame using the `ls_runs()` function:

```{r}
ls_runs()
```
```
