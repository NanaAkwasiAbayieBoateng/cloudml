## Overview

Training models with CloudML uses the following workflow:

- Develop and test an R training script locally

- Submit a job to CloudML to execute your script in the cloud

- Monitor and collect the results of the job

- Tune your model based on the results and repeat training as necessary

This article describes this workflow in more detail.

## Local Development

Working on a CloudML project always begins with developing a training script that runs on your local machine. This will typically involve using one of these packages:

- [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) --- A high-level interface for neural networks, with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

- [tfestimators](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators) --- High-level implementations of common model types such as regressors and classifiers.

- [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) --- Lower-level interface that provides full access to the TensorFlow computational graph.

There are no special requirements for your training script, however there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

1) When you train a model on CloudML all of the files in the current working directory are uploaded. Therefore, your training script should be within the current working directory and references to other scripts, data files, etc. should be relative to the current working directory. As a result, the most straightforward way to organize your work on a CloudML application is to use an [RStudio Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

2) Your training data may be contained within the working directory, or it may be located within Google Cloud Storage. If your training data is large and/or located in cloud storage, the most straightforward workflow for development is to use a local subsample of your data. See the article on [Google Cloud Storage](storage.html) for a detailed example of using distinct data for local and CloudML execution contexts, as well as reading data from Google Cloud Storage buckets.

Once your script is working the way you expect you are ready to submit it as a job to CloudML.

## Submitting Jobs

The core unit of work in CloudML is a job. A job consists of a training script and related files (e.g. other scripts, data files, ec.). To submit a job to CloudML you use the `cloudml_train()` function, passing it the name of the training script to run. For example:

```{r}
library(cloudml)
job <- cloudml_train("minst_mlp.R")
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
Note that the CloudML training and job management functions described here all work relative to the current working directory of your R session, so you should always switch to the working directory containing your scripts before executing these functions.
</div>

The `cloudml_train()` function returns a `job` object. This is a reference to the training job which you can use later to check it's status, collect it's output, etc. For example:

```{r}
job_status(job)
```
```
 $ createTime    : chr "2017-12-18T20:35:21Z"
 $ etag          : chr "2KRqIbAhzvM="
 $ jobId         : chr "cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175"
 $ startTime     : chr "2017-12-18T20:35:52Z"
 $ state         : chr "RUNNING"
 $ trainingInput :List of 3
  ..$ jobDir        : chr "gs://cedar-card-791/r-cloudml/staging"
  ..$ region        : chr "us-east1"
  ..$ runtimeVersion: chr "1.4"
 $ trainingOutput:List of 1
  ..$ consumedMLUnits: num 0.04

https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?resource=ml.googleapis.com%2Fjob_id%2Fcloudml_2017_12_18_203510175&project=cedar-card-791
```

To interact with jobs you don't need the `job` object returned from `cloudml_train()`. If you call `job_status()` or with no arguments it will act on the most recently submitted job:

```{r}
job_status()   # get status of last job
```

## Collecting Job Results 

You can call `job_collect()` at any time to download a job:

```{r}
job_collect()     # collect last job
job_collect(job)  # collect specific job
```

Note also that if you are using RStudio v1.1 or higher you'll be given the to monitor and collect submitted jobs in the background using an RStudio terminal:

![](images/rstudio-terminal.png){.screenshot width=730px}

In this case you don't need to call `job_collect()` explicitly as this will be done from within the background terminal after the job completes.

Once the job is complete it's results will be downloaded and a report will be automatically displayed:

### Training Runs

Each training job will produce one or more training runs (it's typically only a single run, however when doing hyperparmeter turning there will be multiple runs). When you collect a job from CloudML it is automatically downloaded into the `runs` sub-directory of the current working directory.

You can list all of the runs as a data frame using the `ls_runs()` function:

```{r}
ls_runs()
```
```

You can view run reports using the `view_run()` function:

```{r}
# view the latest run
view_run()

# view a specific run
view_run("runs/cloudml_2017_12_15_182614794")
```

There are many tools available to list, filter, and compare training runs. For additional information see the documentation for the [tfruns package](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/articles/overview.html).


## Managing Jobs 

You can enumerate previously submitted jobs using the `job_list()` function:

```{r}
job_list()
```
```
                        JOB_ID    STATUS             CREATED
1 cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 15:35:21
2 cloudml_2017_12_18_202228264    FAILED 2017-12-18 15:22:39
3 cloudml_2017_12_18_201607948 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 15:16:18
4 cloudml_2017_12_18_132620918 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-18 08:26:30
5 cloudml_2017_12_15_182614794 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-15 13:26:29
6 cloudml_2017_12_14_183247626 SUCCEEDED 2017-12-14 13:33:04
```

You can use the `JOB_ID` field to interact with any of these jobs:

```{r}
job_status("cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175")
```

The `job_stream_logs()` function can be used to view the live log of a running job:

```{r}
job_stream_logs("cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175")
```

The `job_cancel()` function can be used to cancel a running job:

```{r}
job_cancel("cloudml_2017_12_18_203510175")
```

## Tuning Your Application

Tuning your application typically requires choosing and then optimizing a set of hyperparameters that influence your model's performance. This could include the number and type of layers, units within layers, drop rates, regularization, etc.

You can experiment with hyperparameters on an ad-hoc basis, but in general it's better to explore them more systematnically. The key to doing this with CloudML is by defining [training flags](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/training_flags.html) within your script and the parameterizing runs using those flags. 

For example, you might define the following training flags:

```{r}
library(keras)

FLAGS <- flags(
  flag_integer("dense_units1", 128),
  flag_numeric("dropout1", 0.4),
  flag_integer("dense_units2", 128),
  flag_numeric("dropout2", 0.3),
  flag_integer("epochs", 30),
  flag_integer("batch_size", 128),
  flag_numeric("learning_rate", 0.001)
)
```

Then use the flags in a script as follows:

```{r}
input <- layer_input(shape = c(784))
predictions <- input %>% 
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS$dense_units1, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = FLAGS$dropout1) %>%
  layer_dense(units = FLAGS$dense_units2, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = FLAGS$dropout2) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

model <- keras_model(input, predictions) %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = FLAGS$learning_rate),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)

history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train,
  batch_size = FLAGS$batch_size,
  epochs = FLAGS$epochs,
  verbose = 1,
  validation_split = 0.2
)
```

Note that instead of literal values for the various hyperparameters we want to vary we now reference members of the FLAGS list returned from the `flags()` function.

You can try out different flags by passing a named list of `flags` to the `cloudml_train()` function. For example:

```{r}
cloudml_train("minst_mlp.R", flags = list(dropout1 = 0.3, dropout2 = 0.2))
```

These flags are recorded and become part of the the results recorded:
